## Usage of the API key in the project: Configuration in the BuildConfig file.

When working on projects that require API integration, it's common to use an API key for authentication and to access services provided by the API provider. In the case of this project, to launch it successfully, you need to provide your personal API key in the BuildConfig file.

The BuildConfig file is part of the Android project structure and contains configuration values specific to the build variant and environment. It's usually generated during the build process and can be accessed from the code.

To provide your API key in the BuildConfig file, follow these steps:

1 - Locate the BuildConfig.java file (for Java) or BuildConfig.kt file (for Kotlin) in your project.
2 - Open the corresponding BuildConfig file in your code editor.
3 - Find the section where you can define constants or configuration variables.
4 - Add a new constant or variable to store your API key. For example, you can name it "API_KEY" and assign it your personal API key.
5 - Ensure to keep your API key confidential by avoiding public exposure, such as using secret management tools or adding the BuildConfig file to your .gitignore file.
6 - Save the BuildConfig file.
Now, you can use this API key in your code by accessing the constant or variable defined in the BuildConfig file. Make sure to load the API key from BuildConfig when making API calls that require authentication.

## **Choice of Architecture**

I chose to implement the MVVM architecture following the guidelines of Clean Architecture to ensure the quality and maintainability of my application. The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture provides a clear separation of responsibilities between different layers of the application. This facilitates code management, testability, and the addition of new features. By implementing the principles of Clean Architecture, I structured my application consistently and in a scalable manner, reducing dependencies between modules and promoting code reusability.

By adopting the principles of Clean Architecture, I was able to divide my application into different distinct layers, such as the presentation layer, interaction layer, and data layer. This helps reduce dependencies between modules and facilitates code reusability, as each layer is responsible for specific tasks.

The presentation layer uses the MVVM model to manage the user interface logic, separating business logic from UI logic. The interaction layer contains the application's use cases, where user actions are processed, and results are transmitted to the presentation layer. Finally, the data layer is responsible for accessing data sources, such as databases or external APIs.

By structuring my application according to the principles of Clean Architecture, I achieved better code maintainability, increased testability, and ease of adding new features. Furthermore, this architecture ensures better isolation of components, making unit testing and code modifications easier without affecting other parts of the application.

In summary, by combining the MVVM architecture and Clean Architecture principles, I could structure my application consistently, reduce dependencies between modules, and promote code reusability. This ensures the quality, maintainability, and scalability of my application while facilitating the addition of new features and managing future changes.

## **Hilt as a Dependency Injection Framework**

I chose to use Hilt as a dependency injection framework for my project due to its numerous advantages. Hilt is an extension of Dagger, one of the most popular dependency injection libraries for Android. By using Hilt, I was able to leverage the stability, maturity, and robustness of Dagger while simplifying the configuration and management of dependencies.

Another reason I chose Hilt is its native support for dependency management based on the lifecycles of Android components such as activities, fragments, and services. This allowed me to automatically handle the lifecycle of injected objects, thereby avoiding potential issues with memory leaks or invalid objects.

Additionally, Hilt encourages a modular approach to architecture, making it easy to divide my project into different independent modules with their own dependency configurations. This improves the maintainability, testability, and reusability of my code while providing greater flexibility during the development and evolution of my project.

In summary, I chose Hilt for its compatibility with Dagger, native Android lifecycle management, modular approach, and active community. Thanks to Hilt, I was able to effectively manage the dependencies in my project, adhere to Android development best practices, and enjoy a smooth and up-to-date development experience.

## **Retrofit for Network Calls**

I used Retrofit in my project for handling network calls. Retrofit provides a clear and concise syntax, simplifying the management of network requests. It is compatible with RESTful specifications and facilitates the serialization and deserialization of JSON data.

Retrofit also efficiently handles network errors, ensuring a reliable user experience. With an active community and comprehensive documentation, it is easy to find resources and solutions when needed.

In summary, Retrofit has proven to be a smart choice for handling network calls due to its simplicity, compatibility, and error-handling capabilities.

## **Inclusion of Unit Tests and Instrumentation Tests with Hilt**

I have included both unit tests and instrumentation tests in my application to ensure its quality and proper functioning. Unit tests are used to verify the behavior of the ViewModel and utility functions in isolation, ensuring their correct operation independently of the rest of the application. These tests allow me to ensure that each component works correctly and to quickly detect any potential errors.

On the other hand, I have also integrated instrumentation tests, which are end-to-end tests of the user interface. These tests simulate real user interactions with the application and verify that the correct elements are displayed on the screen and that navigation works properly. To facilitate these tests, I used Hilt to manage dependencies and created a fake repository to replace API calls with simulated data. This allows me to ensure the proper functioning of the application in real scenarios and to ensure that all features are correctly implemented.

Including these tests in my development process gives me the confidence to ensure the stability of my application and to make changes and improvements safely. Unit tests help me detect errors at the code level, while instrumentation tests allow me to validate the proper functioning of the application as a whole. This enables me to provide a high-quality user experience and ensure that my application works as intended in different situations

## **Using Jetpack Compose and Material 3 for UI Design**

For the user interface design, I utilized Jetpack Compose and Material 3. Jetpack Compose is Google's new declarative UI development toolkit that enables the creation of modern, responsive, and flexible user interfaces. Material 3 is the latest version of Google's design library, offering components and visual styles in line with the latest trends in user interfaces.

By using Jetpack Compose and Material 3, I was able to design an interface that aligns with Google's latest standards and trends in user interfaces. This makes my application compatible with the latest Android versions and gives it a modern and professional appearance.

Furthermore, Jetpack Compose provides better flexibility and ease of development compared to older design libraries. It facilitates the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces, offering an immersive and enjoyable user experience.

In summary, using Jetpack Compose and Material 3 for UI design ensures compatibility with the latest Google UI trends, easy extension of the application with new features, and the delivery of a modern and appealing user experience.
